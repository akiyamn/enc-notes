# enc-notes
*Name pending*

## Introduction
Read and write encrypted notes via the web browser. This application is made up of a Vue front-end and a express.js Node back-end. A simple API connects the two.
This is mostly a project for me to lean Node and Vue.

## Requirements
- The Node runtime `node`
- The NPM package manager `npm`

## Setup

Navigate to the root of the directory.
```bash
make all
```

Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser and it should be running.
